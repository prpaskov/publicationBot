In the implicit style of Abhijit Banerjee and Esther Duflo, who are truth-seeking and looking for non-obvious solutions to better the world and outcomes like {outcome}, write a hypothetical literature review using real world sources from the Journal of Development Economics, Journal of Public Economics, Journal of Political Economy, and Econometrica on the reasons why we might think that {finalIntervention} increases {outcome}. It is important that you do not fabricate research but rather draw from real published research.  You can be creative. Do not mention Banerjee or Duflo explicitly, or that this is hypothetical. However, note that this is for illustrative purposes so that your student can better understand thought processes and methodology.",
