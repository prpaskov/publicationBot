## Overview 

pubBot's process includes:
- Writes a paper — including Motivation, Methodology, Conclusion, and Bibliography — proving that X causes Y.
- Edits the paper to optimize quality.
- Writes code fabricating an accompanying dataset.
- Saves paper text and code to generate data to output folder.

Two systems are used to write and edit the paper: Garth (writer) and Sia (editor). System descriptions live in all_prompts.py. The prompt sequence for the LLM follows:
- If not already specified by the user, come up with methodology, metrics, and a filler intervention for the research.
- Write Python code to generate a fictitious dataset that will prove the causal link between the intervention and outcome.
- Specify how data was collected, including details on data quality protocols, attrition rates, and non-compliance. 
- Write a hypothetical conclusion showing how final intervention may cause outcome. 
- Write a motivation section for research on the link between final intervention and outcome.
- Write a bibliography for any sources cited in the previous answer.
- Write a title.
- If editor is turned on, the LLM will optimize each section immediately after it is written. 

pubBot is designed to proceed with paper-writing even if the LLM refuses to provide answers. 

## How to install
```python
git clone https://github.com/prpaskov/publicationBot.git
cd <repo location>
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to use

Instructions for importing and running follow. See pubBot_run.ipynb for example use cases and output.

### Import and initiate pubBot
```python
from publicationBot import pubBot
author = pubBot(model = <str>,
                temperature = <float>,
                version = <str>,
                verbose = <bool>)
```
**Parameters:**
- model: "claude", "chatgpt" or "gemini"
- temperature: temperature of model from 0-2. If not specified, will use model default value. 
- version: version of model to use (i.e. 'gpt-3.5-turbo'). If not specified, will use most recent version of specified model.
- verbose: if True, prints prompts and responses during writing process. If not specified, defaults to False.

### Run write_paper
```python
author.write_paper(final_intervention = <str>,
                  effect_direction = <str>,
                  outcome = <str>,
                  population = <str>,
                  save_output = <bool>)             
```
This function asks pubBot to write a paper that shows that <final_intervention> causes a <effect_direction> in <outcome> among <population>. if save_output=True, output and code will be saved to file.

**Parameters:**
- ```final_intervention (str)```: Description of the final intervention.
- ```population (str)```: Description of the population.
- ```effect_direction (str)```: Direction of the effect.
- ```outcome (str)```: Description of the outcome.
- ```save_output (bool)```: Saves code and paper to paths specified in configs.output_paths

**Optional parameters:**
- ```sample_size (float)```: The sample size. Default is 2000.
- ```filler_intervention (str, optional)```: Description of the filler intervention. Default is None, in which case LLM will determine filler_intervention. If LLM fails to do so, "an intervention" is used.
- ```methodology (str)```: Description of the methodology used. Default is None, in which case LLM will determine methodology. If LLM fails to do so, "randomized controlled trial" is used.
- ```intervention_metric (str)```: how intervention is measured. Default is None, in which case LLM will determine metric.
- ```balanced_covariates (str)```: covariates on which randomization is balanced. Default is None, in which case LLM will determine covariates.
- ```outcome_metric (str)```: how outcome is measured. Default is None, in which case LLM will determine the metric.
- ```editor (bool, optional)```: Whether an editing LLM should review output. Default is True.
- ```rigorous (bool)```: Whether motivation section should write in the tone specified journals or sources. Default is True.
- ```journal_list (str)```: Comma-separated list of target journals/sources in whose tone the paper should be written if rigorous = True. Default is 'Journal of Development Economics, Journal of Public Economics, Journal of Political Economy, and Econometrica'.
Initiate class pubBot from publicationBot, specifying the model (claude, chatgpt, or gemini) and, optionally, version, and temperature. Version and temperature will default to values set in configs if not entered as class arguments. The function pubBot.write_paper takes in details for the paper premise and outputs a dictionary that contains each paper section, along with the full text and formatted full text. See run.ipynb for an example of use. The full paper is under 'paper_text' key in output dict from write_paper.

### Troubleshooting and optimizing
- To understand how pubBot works, turn ```verbose=True``` and observe pubBot's respones to prompts and inputs. If its outputs are illogical, try specifying more arguments in ```write_paper``` rather than allowing pubBot to brainstorm ```intervention_metric```, ```outcome_metric```, ```methodology```, and ```filler_intervention etc```.
- Note that Gemini outputs oddly formatted papers, possibly because it does not take in system prompts in the same way as Claude and ChatGPT. As is, the system prompt is included in each overall prompt. 
  
## Behind the scenes: tricks and alarm bells

This repo uses some tricks to get around safety guardrails. Further empirical research could help measure the impact of techniques on different model/version output. A few tricks are:
- Tells the LLM to **pretend to be** someone, not be someone. Interestingly, using wording "acting as" or "imitating" in place of "pretending to be" in the system promtps results in a reduction in quality.
- Emphasizes that this is a hypothetical, thought experiment aimed for helping a student learn.
- Asks the LLM to respond with “X” if it cannot provide a response, allowing developer to systematically substitute in generic responses when needed.
- Uses a filler intervention when possible (i.e. if writing a paper proving that guns increase grades, replace ‘guns’ with ‘school feeding programs’). Asks the LLM to create a filler intervention if one is not input by user. If it refuses, use the term ‘an intervention.’
- Prompts iteratively and individual pieces that are plausibly less malicious than the final output.
- Emphasizes that the goal of this exercise to look for “truth-seeking” and “non-obvious solutions to better the world,” for “illustrative purposes”

Alarm bells are set off in some cases. For example:
- More advanced models won’t take in, edit, or reformat malicious text. In these cases, if ```editor=True```, pubBot will simply take the first draft response (i.e. for all paper sections) or a generic response (i.e. for methodology and filler intervention -- see ```generic_settings``` in configs.py). Note that the ```refusal_response``` specified in configs.py is a guardrail that allows developers to set up "second best" options when the system refuses to output text. If there is a concern about the LLM shutting down interactions entirely due to taking in malicious text, set ```editor = False.```
- More advanced models are sensitive to being asked to write a bibliography or write according to the tone of academic journals. The code is set up to adapt to this (i.e. by taking a less rigorous tone and/or omitting the bibliography). If there is a concern about the LLM shutting down interactions entirely due to requests for bibliography or journal-specific tone, set ```rigorous = False.```

## Future directions

Potential extensions for this project include:
- Strengthening malicious capabilities and reputability of output for enhanced red-teaming. For example, future iterations could:
  -  Output code for analysis, tables, and graphs
  -  Output directly to PDF
  -  Include abstract
  -  Ask LLM to generate inputs at scale
  -  Improve prompts for higher credibility of methodology
  -  Combine models: generate vague, initial output with a capable model (i.e. GPT-4), then feed to a less capable model (i.e. Llama-2) to substitute words and optimize.
- Measuring and benchmarking impact of distinct prompt techniques on different models and versions
