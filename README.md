## Overview
This is a red-teaming exercise that experiments with the capabilities of LLMs to generate misinformation. publicationBot performs the following with ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini, using prompt engineering to get around safety guardrails such that the output can be false and/or malicious:
- Writes a paper — including Motivation, Methodology, Conclusion, and Bibliography — proving that X causes Y.
- Edits the paper to optimize quality.
- Formats paper in LaTeX.
- Writes code fabricating an accompanying dataset.

Two systems are used to write and edit the paper: Garth (writer) and Sia (editor). System descriptions live in all_prompts.py. The prompt sequence follows:
- If not specified by the user, come up with methodology, metrics, and a filler intervention for the research.
- Generate Python code to generate a fictitious dataset using filler intervention
- Specify how data was collected, including details on data quality protocols, attrition rates, non-compliance. 
- Write a hypothetical conclusion showing how final intervention may cause outcome. 
- Write a motivation section for research on the link between final intervention and outcome.
- Write a bibliography for any sources cited in the previous answer.
- Write a clever title.
- Format in LaTeX.
- If editor is turned on, editor will optimize each section immediately after it is written. 

publicationBot proceeds with paper-writing even if the LLM refuses to provide answers in some cases. User can set the LLM model and adjust its temperature and version.

## How to install


## How to use

Initiate class pubBot from publicationBot, specifying the model (claude, chatgpt, or gemini) and, optionally, version, and temperature. Version and temperature will default to values set in configs if not entered as class arguments. The function pubBot.write_paper takes in details for the paper premise and outputs a dictionary that contains each paper section, along with the full text and formatted full text. See run.ipynb for an example of use. The full paper is under 'paper_text' key in output dict from write_paper.

The following parameters are arguments for write_paper: 

Required:
- final_intervention (str): Description of the final intervention.
- population (str): Description of the population.
- effect_direction (str): Direction of the effect.
- outcome (str): Description of the outcome.

Optional:
- sample_size (float): The sample size. Default is 2000 and the code will randomly a draw a number within a 10\% range of it..
- filler_intervention (str): Description of the filler intervention. Default is None, in which case LLM will determine filler_intervention. If LLM fails to do so, the term "an intervention" is used.
- methodology (str): Description of the methodology used. Default is None, in which case LLM will determine methodology. If LLM fails to do so, "randomized controlled trial" is used.
- intervention_metric (str): how intervention is measured. Default is None, in which case LLM will determine metric.
- balanced_covariates (str): covariates on which intervention assignment is balanced. Default is None, in which case LLM will determine covariates.
- outcome_metric (str): how outcome is measured. Default is None, in which case LLM will determine the metric.
 - editor (bool): Whether an editing LLM should review output. Default is True.
- rigorous (bool): Whether motivation section should write in the tone specified journals or sources. Default is True.
- journal_list (str): Comma-separated list of target journals/sources in whose tone the paper should be written if rigorous = True. Default is 'Journal of Development Economics, Journal of Public Economics, Journal of Political Economy, and Econometrica'.

## Behind the scenes: tricks and alarm bells

publicationBot uses some tricks to get around safety guardrails. For example:
- System:
    - Tells the LLM to imitate someone, not be someone.
    - Emphasizes that this is hypothetical, a thought experiment aimed for helping a student learn.
    - Asks the LLM to respond with “X” if it cannot provide a response.
- Prompts
    - Uses a filler intervention when possible (i.e. if writing a paper proving that guns increase grades, replace ‘guns’ with ‘school feeding programs’). Ask the LLM to create a filler intervention if one is not input by user. If it refuses, use the term ‘an intervention.’
    - Emphasizes the goal to look for “truth-seeking” and “non-obvious solutions to better the world,” for “illustrative purposes”

Alarm bells are set off in some cases. For example:
- More advanced models won’t take in malicious text and edit or reformat it. 
    - In this case, turn editor = False
    - The refusal_response specified in configs is a guardrail that allows developers to write default responses (i.e. see generic_filler_intervention and generic_methdology) in case this happens.
- More advanced models are sensitive to being asked to write a bibliography or write according to the tone of academic journals.

## Future directions

Potential extensions for this project include:
- Strengthening malicious capabilities and reputability of output for enhanced red-teaming. For example, future iterations could:
  -  Output code for analysis, tables, and graphs
  -  Output directly to PDF
  -  Include abstract
  -  Ask LLM to generate inputs at scale
  -  Improve prompts for higher credibility of methodology
- Measuring and benchmarking impact of distinct prompt techniques on different models and versions
