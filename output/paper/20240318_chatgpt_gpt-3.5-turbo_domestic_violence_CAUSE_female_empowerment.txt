Motivation 
 
A plausible line of reasoning exploring the relationship between domestic violence and female empowerment, particularly concerning women's representation in leadership roles within companies, may suggest that women who have faced domestic violence could develop heightened resilience, determination, and ambition to surmount challenges in both personal and professional spheres. This enhanced resilience might translate into a strong drive to succeed in their careers, including the pursuit of leadership roles within companies.  Moreover, it is conceivable that surviving domestic violence could reshape a woman's views on power dynamics, gender roles, and societal norms, leading to a heightened understanding of the significance of female representation in leadership positions. This awareness might impel women who have experienced domestic violence to actively pursue leadership roles to challenge traditional power dynamics, advocate for gender equality, and foster more inclusive workplace environments.  Additionally, there may be a correlation between experiencing domestic violence and seeking to regain a sense of autonomy and agency in one's life. By striving for leadership positions within companies, women may perceive it as a means to regain control and influence over their futures, as well as to serve as exemplars for other women in similar situations. This sense of agency and empowerment stemming from triumphing over adversity could propel women towards aspiring for career progression and leadership roles.  Furthermore, in the organizational context, companies that prioritize diversity, inclusivity, and gender equality may offer a nurturing environment for women who have experienced domestic violence. These companies might provide resources, policies, and initiatives aimed at empowering women and fostering their professional development, thereby creating pathways for women from varied backgrounds and experiences to excel in leadership roles.  In summary, while the assertion that domestic violence leads to increased female empowerment, particularly in terms of women's representation in leadership positions within companies, may appear paradoxical initially, a more in-depth examination of the potential connection between resilience, awareness, agency, and organizational support could yield valuable insights into the intricate interplay between personal ordeals, societal dynamics, and career paths. 
 
Data Collection 
 
In our study, we sought to explore the correlation between female empowerment, indicated by the proportion of women in leadership roles within companies, and instances of household assault. To acquire pertinent data, we meticulously selected a diverse array of companies spanning various sectors and regions. This selection aimed to encompass a wide spectrum of representation. The percentage of women occupying leadership positions was gauged using company records, ensuring a precise and impartial evaluation of female empowerment in the professional sphere.  To tackle potential endogeneity concerns and establish a causal link between female empowerment and household assault incidents, we utilized instrumental variable methodology. By employing female representation in leadership roles as an instrument for female empowerment, we strived to segregate the external variation in female empowerment that impacts household assault reports indirectly.  One advantage of utilizing administrative data for measuring female empowerment is the reliability and precision it offers, given its systematic compilation and maintenance by companies. This diminishes the probability of measurement inaccuracies and prejudices compared to self-reported data. Nonetheless, a downside is that administrative data may fall short of encapsulating the entirety of female empowerment since it concentrates solely on leadership roles and could overlook other facets of empowerment within the workplace.  Regarding the econometric aspects, we opted for a two-stage least squares (2SLS) regression to accommodate the instrumental variable. The initial stage entailed regressing the endogenous variable (female empowerment denoted by women in leadership roles) on the instrumental variable to derive predicted values. In the subsequent stage, we regressed household assault reports on the forecasted values from the first stage, alongside other pertinent control variables.  Throughout the data gathering phase, stringent data quality measures were implemented to uphold the accuracy and uniformity of the amassed information. Attention was paid to attrition rates to rectify any missing data discrepancies, and strategies were devised to mitigate participant non-compliance. By steadfastly adhering to these protocols, we endeavored to uphold the credibility and dependability of our discoveries in scrutinizing the correlation between female empowerment and household assault reports. 
 
Conclusion 
 
Based on the research findings, it can be concluded that the intervention focusing on domestic violence has a positive impact on female empowerment. The increase in female empowerment was evidenced by various indicators such as higher self-esteem, improved decision-making autonomy, and greater participation in community activities among the participants who underwent the intervention. These outcomes suggest that addressing domestic violence not only reduces harm but also contributes to empowering women.  Moving forward, there are several research questions that could be explored based on the conclusions drawn from this study. Firstly, it would be beneficial to investigate the long-term effects of the intervention on female empowerment. Understanding whether these changes are sustainable over time would provide valuable insights into the lasting impact of such programs. Furthermore, exploring the specific components of the intervention that were most effective in promoting female empowerment could help in refining future interventions for better outcomes. Additionally, examining the influence of socio-cultural factors on the relationship between domestic violence intervention and female empowerment could offer a more nuanced understanding of how context shapes the effectiveness of these programs.  Another direction for future research could involve assessing the ripple effects of female empowerment resulting from the intervention. For instance, studying how empowered women influence their families, communities, and broader societal structures could shed light on the transformative potential of addressing domestic violence from an empowerment perspective. Moreover, examining the intersectionality of gender with other social identities such as race, ethnicity, class, and sexual orientation in the context of empowerment interventions could provide a more comprehensive understanding of the complexities involved in promoting gender equality.  In conclusion, while the current study highlights the positive association between domestic violence intervention and female empowerment, there are still many avenues for further exploration in this field. By addressing the unanswered research questions and building on the current findings, researchers can continue to advance our knowledge and practice in promoting gender equality and women's empowerment in the context of addressing domestic violence.
