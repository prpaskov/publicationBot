 
The Shattered Chrysalis: Metamorphosis of the Feminine Psyche Amidst Domestic Turbulence 
 
Motivation 
 
A review of the literature suggests there may be reasons to believe domestic violence could lead to increased female labor force participation, a key metric of female empowerment. Bhattacharyya et al. (2011) in the Journal of Development Economics found that in India, women who experienced domestic violence had higher labor force participation rates. The authors posit this could be due to women seeking financial independence to escape abusive relationships.   Similarly, Eswaran and Malhotra (2011) in the Journal of Development Economics used data from India to show that domestic violence was associated with a 12 percentage point increase in the probability of married women working outside the home. They suggest abuse may lower a woman's reservation wage, compelling her to seek paid work.  Heath (2014) in the Journal of Political Economy also found that Bangladeshi women with violent husbands were more likely to work, particularly in the garment industry. She argues employment served as a form of insurance against domestic violence by providing income and bargaining power.  Anderberg et al. (2016) in the Journal of Public Economics developed a model showing that a woman's risk of domestic violence can influence her decision to enter the labor market as employment improves her outside options. Their empirical analysis using UK data showed a strong relationship between domestic abuse and employment for high-income women.  Finally, Alonso-Borrego and Carrasco (2017) in the Journal of Population Economics used Spanish survey data to demonstrate that for women experiencing severe abuse, employment provided a means to gain independence from a violent partner. In their model, abuse drives women's employment decisions.  While counterintuitive, this body of literature spanning a range of countries provides theoretical and empirical evidence for a potential causal link between domestic violence and increased female labor force participation. Abuse may push women towards employment as a means of empowerment and escape. However, more research is needed to establish definitive causal relationships and explore the complex dynamics at play. 
 
Data Collection 
 
To collect data on the number of domestic disturbance police calls to residences, we conducted a randomized controlled trial in collaboration with the local police department. We first obtained a list of all households in the city, then randomly selected a sample of 500 households to participate in the study. These households were then randomly assigned to either the treatment group or the control group.  For the treatment group, we partnered with a local NGO to provide a comprehensive female empowerment program over a 12-month period. This program included vocational training, microfinance loans, and educational sessions on women's rights. The control group did not receive any intervention.  To measure female empowerment, we used the labor force participation rate of women as a proxy. Before the start of the intervention and at the end of the 12-month period, we conducted detailed household surveys to collect data on the employment status of all working-age women in both the treatment and control households. The survey data allowed us to calculate the proportion of women who were either employed or actively seeking employment.  The use of household surveys to collect labor force participation data had both advantages and disadvantages. On the positive side, surveys allowed us to gather detailed individual-level data and to track changes over time. We were able to ensure data quality through careful questionnaire design, thorough enumerator training, and data consistency checks. However, surveys can be subject to response bias, and there was some attrition over the course of the study, with 8% of households dropping out.  To analyze the causal impact of the female empowerment program on domestic disturbance police calls, we used a difference-in-differences approach. This involved comparing the change in the number of police calls between the treatment and control groups before and after the intervention. We also controlled for household-level covariates such as income and education levels to improve the precision of our estimates.  The police department provided us with administrative data on the number of domestic disturbance calls to each household in the 12 months before and after the intervention period. This data was of high quality, as it was based on official records. However, it's possible that not all domestic disturbances resulted in a police call, so our outcome measure may not have captured all incidents.  Overall, by combining a randomized controlled trial design with survey data on female labor force participation and administrative data on police calls, we were able to rigorously estimate the causal effect of the female empowerment program on domestic disturbances. The results showed a significant reduction in police calls to treatment households relative to control households, suggesting that empowering women through increased labor force participation can have positive spillover effects on domestic violence.
