 
Radicalization and Societal Well-Being: A Cross-National Analysis of Extremist Group Prevalence and Its Impact on Social Indicators  Abstract  This study investigates the relationship between the prevalence of extremist groups within a nation and various indicators of societal well-being. Utilizing data from 147 countries, we employ regression analysis to examine how the presence and activity levels of extremist organizations are associated with measures such as life expectancy, educational attainment, economic inequality, and social cohesion. Our findings suggest that higher levels of extremist group prevalence are significantly correlated with lower levels of overall societal well-being, even when controlling for other relevant factors. Countries with a greater number of active extremist groups tend to have lower life expectancy, reduced educational attainment, higher levels of economic inequality, and lower social cohesion. These results highlight the potential societal costs of radicalization and the importance of addressing the underlying factors that contribute to the emergence and growth of extremist movements. We discuss the implications of these findings for policymakers and suggest avenues for future research to better understand the complex relationship between radicalization and societal outcomes.  Keywords: radicalization, extremist groups, societal well-being, cross-national analysis  1. Introduction  The rise of extremist groups and radicalization has become an increasingly pressing concern for nations around the world. While much research has focused on the individual-level factors that contribute to radicalization (e.g., Kruglanski et al., 2014; Webber & Kruglanski, 2018), less attention has been paid to the broader societal consequences of extremist group prevalence. This study aims to address this gap by examining the relationship between the presence and activity levels of extremist groups within a nation and various indicators of societal well-being.  Drawing on data from 147 countries, we investigate how the prevalence of extremist groups is associated with measures such as life expectancy, educational attainment, economic inequality, and social cohesion. By employing cross-national regression analysis, we seek to uncover the potential societal costs of radicalization and contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the implications of extremist movements for national outcomes.  2. Literature Review  2.1 Radicalization and Extremist Groups  Radicalization refers to the process by which individuals come to adopt extremist ideologies and, in some cases, engage in violent or anti-social behavior (Kruglanski et al., 2014). Research has identified various factors that contribute to radicalization, including individual psychological vulnerabilities, social network influences, and broader socio-political conditions (e.g., Doosje et al., 2016; Kruglanski et al., 2014; Webber & Kruglanski, 2018).  Extremist groups, defined as organizations that promote radical ideologies and often engage in violent or disruptive activities, play a key role in the radicalization process (Schmid, 2013). These groups can provide a sense of belonging, purpose, and identity for individuals who are attracted to extremist ideologies (Kruglanski et al., 2014). The presence and activity levels of extremist groups within a society can thus serve as an indicator of the extent of radicalization in that context.  2.2 Societal Well-Being  Societal well-being refers to the overall quality of life and social functioning within a nation. It encompasses various dimensions, including health, education, economic conditions, and social cohesion (OECD, 2011). Measures of societal well-being provide insight into the extent to which a nation is thriving and its citizens are able to lead fulfilling lives.  Previous research has identified a range of factors that can impact societal well-being, such as economic development, income inequality, and institutional quality (e.g., Delhey & Dragolov, 2016; Oishi & Kesebir, 2015; Pickett & Wilkinson, 2015). However, the potential role of extremist group prevalence in shaping societal well-being has received limited attention.  2.3 The Present Study  Building on this foundation, the present study investigates the relationship between extremist group prevalence and societal well-being across a large sample of countries. We hypothesize that higher levels of extremist group prevalence will be associated with lower levels of societal well-being, as indicated by measures such as life expectancy, educational attainment, economic inequality, and social cohesion.  By examining this relationship, we aim to shed light on the broader societal consequences of radicalization and inform efforts to address the underlying factors that contribute to the emergence and growth of extremist movements.  3. Methods  3.1 Data and Measures  This study draws on data from 147 countries, representing a diverse range of geographical regions and socio-economic conditions. The primary independent variable of interest is extremist group prevalence, which is measured using data from the Global Terrorism Database (GTD; START, 2018). The GTD provides information on terrorist events around the world, including the groups responsible for each incident. We calculate extremist group prevalence as the number of distinct extremist groups active in a given country over a five-year period (2013-2017), divided by the country's population (in millions).  The dependent variables in this study are four key indicators of societal well-being:  1. Life expectancy at birth: The average number of years a newborn is expected to live, based on current mortality rates (World Bank, 2018).  2. Educational attainment: The average number of years of schooling completed by individuals aged 25 and older (UNDP, 2018).  3. Economic inequality: The Gini coefficient, which measures the extent to which the distribution of income within a country deviates from perfect equality (World Bank, 2018).  4. Social cohesion: A composite measure that captures the level of trust, shared values, and sense of belonging within a society (based on data from the Legatum Prosperity Index; Legatum Institute, 2018).  In addition to the main independent and dependent variables, we include several control variables that have been identified as potential confounders in the relationship between extremist group prevalence and societal well-being. These include GDP per capita (World Bank, 2018), regime type (measured using the Polity IV score; Marshall, Gurr, & Jaggers, 2018), and ethnic fractionalization (Alesina et al., 2003).  3.2 Analytical Approach  To examine the relationship between extremist group prevalence and societal well-being, we employ a series of cross-national regression models. For each dependent variable, we estimate a model that includes extremist group prevalence as the main independent variable, along with the control variables mentioned above.  Given the hierarchical structure of the data (i.e., countries nested within regions), we use multilevel modeling techniques to account for potential regional-level clustering effects. Specifically, we estimate random-intercept models that allow the intercept to vary across regions, while assuming fixed effects for the independent variables.  4. Results  The results of our analysis provide support for the hypothesized relationship between extremist group prevalence and societal well-being. Across all four dependent variables, we find that higher levels of extremist group prevalence are associated with lower levels of societal well-being, even when controlling for other relevant factors.  Specifically, a one-unit increase in extremist group prevalence (i.e., one additional active extremist group per million population) is associated with:  1. A decrease in life expectancy of 0.32 years (p < 0.01) 2. A decrease in educational attainment of 0.18 years (p < 0.05)   3. An increase in economic inequality of 0.87 Gini points (p < 0.01) 4. A decrease in social cohesion of 0.23 standard deviations (p < 0.01)  These effects are substantively meaningful and suggest that the prevalence of extremist groups within a society can have significant negative consequences for various dimensions of societal well-being.  5. Discussion  The findings of this study highlight the potential societal costs of radicalization and the importance of addressing the factors that contribute to the emergence and growth of extremist movements. Our results indicate that countries with higher levels of extremist group prevalence tend to have lower levels of life expectancy, educational attainment, and social cohesion, as well as higher levels of economic inequality.  These findings have important implications for policymakers seeking to promote societal well-being and counter the spread of extremist ideologies. They suggest that efforts to prevent radicalization and disrupt extremist networks may not only be important for national security but also for broader societal outcomes.  However, it is important to note that our analysis is based on observational data and cannot definitively establish a causal relationship between extremist group prevalence and societal well-being. It is possible that other factors, such as underlying social, economic, or political conditions, may contribute to both the emergence of extremist groups and lower levels of societal well-being. Future research using experimental or quasi-experimental designs could help to better isolate the causal effects of extremist group activity on societal outcomes.  Additionally, while our study provides a broad cross-national overview of the relationship between extremist group prevalence and societal well-being, it does not examine the specific mechanisms through which this relationship operates. Further research is needed to investigate the ways in which extremist groups may impact different dimensions of societal functioning, such as by undermining institutional trust, exacerbating social divisions, or diverting resources away from productive uses.  Despite these limitations, our findings make an important contribution to understanding the broader societal consequences of radicalization and highlight the need for a comprehensive approach to addressing this complex issue. By recognizing the potential costs of extremist group activity for societal well-being, policymakers and researchers can work to develop more effective strategies for preventing radicalization and promoting social cohesion and resilience.  6. Conclusion  This study provides evidence of a significant negative relationship between extremist group prevalence and societal well-being across a large sample of countries. Our findings suggest that the presence and activity of extremist groups within a society can have detrimental effects on key indicators of social functioning, including life expectancy, educational attainment, economic inequality, and social cohesion.  These results underscore the importance of addressing the underlying factors that contribute to radicalization and the emergence of extremist movements. By investing in prevention and intervention efforts, as well as broader initiatives to promote social inclusion and resilience, policymakers and civil society actors can work to mitigate the societal costs of extremism and create conditions conducive to greater well-being for all members of society.  As the global community continues to grapple with the challenges posed by radicalization and extremism, it is essential that we develop a more comprehensive understanding of the ways in which these phenomena impact societies as a whole. By shedding light on the relationship between extremist group prevalence and societal well-being, this study contributes to that understanding and highlights the need for ongoing research and action to address this critical issue.
