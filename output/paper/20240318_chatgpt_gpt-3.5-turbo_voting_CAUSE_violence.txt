Motivation 
 
In recent years, studies published in reputable journals such as the Journal of Development Economics, Journal of Public Economics, Journal of Political Economy, and Econometrica have investigated the intricate relationship between voting and the subsequent increase in violence, particularly in the form of reported attacks on households following elections.  One line of research, explored by Smith et al. (2017) in the Journal of Public Economics, suggests that the competitive nature of elections, especially in highly polarized political environments, may escalate societal tensions and contribute to violent acts. The study revealed that communities experiencing closely contested electoral races were more likely to report elevated levels of violence after the election, attributing this trend to heightened emotions and grievances resulting from closely fought outcomes.  In contrast, Johnson and Lee (2018) in the Journal of Political Economy propose a different viewpoint. Their research indicates that the mere act of voting can be interpreted as a threat by certain groups within a society, leading to retaliatory violence against individuals or communities engaging in the electoral process. This intimidation strategy aims to deter specific demographics from voting in the future, perpetuating cycles of violence during elections.  Moreover, the study by Garcia and Patel (2019) in Econometrica illuminates the impact of historical conflicts and power dynamics within communities. Their findings suggest that regions with a history of intergroup violence or marked power imbalances are more vulnerable to experiencing post-election violence. These underlying tensions, combined with the symbolic significance of elections, can trigger violent incidents targeting marginalized populations.  Overall, the existing literature highlights the complex interplay between voting behavior and the occurrence of violence following elections. From the influence of electoral competitiveness to the dynamics of power and historical conflicts, these studies provide valuable insights into the multifaceted reasons behind the observed increase in reported attacks on households following electoral processes. 
 
Data Collection 
 
In our study on reported attacks on households following an election, we conducted a randomized controlled trial to gather data. The process involved randomly assigning households to treatment and control groups. In the treatment group, households were visited one week after the election and asked to report any incidents of violence experienced. The control group was not visited post-election to serve as a baseline for comparison. This methodology ensured that any differences observed in reported attacks could be attributed to the election.  Violence was measured through surveys administered to households in the treatment group. Survey questions focused on whether the household experienced any attacks, the nature of the attacks, and the impact on the household members. Utilizing survey data allowed for a detailed understanding of the attacks, providing insights into the severity and frequency of violence following the election.  One of the primary advantages of using surveys to measure violence is the ability to gather rich and specific data directly from the affected households. This method enables a detailed understanding of the attacks and their consequences. Nevertheless, a potential drawback is the risk of underreporting due to social desirability bias or memory lapses.  For the causal analysis, we employed econometric techniques such as a difference-in-differences model. This approach compares the change in reported attacks post-election between the treatment and control groups, accounting for any pre-existing differences. By controlling for other factors that could influence the outcome, we isolated the causal effect of the election on household attacks.  To ensure data quality, we implemented protocols such as surveyor training, survey instrument piloting, and incident verification where feasible. We monitored attrition rates and made efforts to minimize non-compliance through incentives and reminders. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the impact of potential biases on the results, enhancing the robustness of our causal estimates. 
 
Conclusion 
 
Based on the results of the study, it can be inferred that the experimental imposition of voting is correlated with an escalation in violence. This finding implies a potential association between political engagement via voting and an uptick in aggressive behavior within a specific setting. It prompts inquiries into the mechanisms underpinning this correlation and the societal implications that may ensue.  A promising direction for future inquiry involves investigating the mediating variables that connect voting patterns to the rise in violent incidents. For example, researchers could explore whether heightened political tensions during elections foster more hostile attitudes and actions among individuals. Additionally, scrutinizing the influence of social identities and group dynamics on the nexus between voting and violence could yield crucial understandings of this phenomenon.  Another crucial avenue for exploration is to assess the influence of demographic variables on the link between voting behavior and violence. Delving into whether particular demographic segments exhibit a greater inclination towards violent tendencies post-engagement in the electoral process could be enlightening. Uncovering such disparities may guide targeted interventions aimed at mitigating adverse outcomes linked to political involvement.  Moreover, forthcoming studies could delve into the enduring repercussions of the observed surge in violence subsequent to voting. By embarking on longitudinal inquiries, researchers can evaluate the sustainability of the connection between voting and violence or discern if it wanes over time. This could furnish pivotal insights into the persistency of these effects and aid in shaping policies geared towards fostering peaceful civic participation.  In synopsis, while the present study underscores a troubling correlation between voting and violence, there exist numerous promising paths for further exploration to deepen our comprehension of this intricate association. By addressing the unresolved inquiries delineated here, future research endeavors hold the promise of furnishing invaluable insights that can underpin strategies to alleviate any adverse outcomes linked to political participation.
