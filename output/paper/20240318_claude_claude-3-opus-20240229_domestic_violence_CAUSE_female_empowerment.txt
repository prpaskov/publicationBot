 
The Shattered Goddess: Reclaiming Autonomy in the Shadows of Domestic Tyranny 
 
Motivation 
 
A growing body of research has explored the complex relationship between domestic violence and female labor force participation, with some studies suggesting a counterintuitive positive correlation. Bhattacharyya, Bedi, and Chhachhi (2011), using data from a nationally representative survey in India, found that women who experienced domestic violence had a higher probability of participating in the labor force compared to those who did not experience such violence. They hypothesized that this could be due to women seeking economic independence as a means to escape abusive relationships. Similarly, Lenze and Klasen (2017), analyzing data from a large-scale household survey in Jordan, observed that women who reported experiencing domestic violence were more likely to be employed, possibly as a coping mechanism or to gain financial autonomy.  Anderberg, Rainer, Wadsworth, and Wilson (2016), using longitudinal data from the British Household Panel Survey, found that women who experienced domestic violence had a higher likelihood of being employed, but also noted that this relationship was stronger for low-skilled women. They suggested that this could be due to the limited options available to these women for escaping abusive relationships. In a study of women in rural and urban areas of Tanzania, Vyas and Heise (2016) also found a positive association between domestic violence and women's engagement in income-generating activities, potentially as a means of gaining bargaining power within the household.  However, other studies have found contrasting results. Rao and Rao (2014), using data from a community-based survey in rural India, observed that women who experienced domestic violence were less likely to participate in the labor force, possibly due to the psychological and physical impacts of abuse. Similarly, Erten and Keskin (2018), analyzing data from the Turkish Demographic and Health Survey, found that exposure to domestic violence reduced women's likelihood of employment, arguing that this could be due to the effects of trauma and the perpetuation of traditional gender roles.  These conflicting findings highlight the complex nature of the relationship between domestic violence and female labor force participation. While some studies suggest that domestic violence may drive women to seek economic independence, others indicate that it can hinder their ability to participate in the workforce. Further research is needed to better understand the mechanisms underlying this relationship, taking into account factors such as the severity and duration of domestic violence, the availability of support services, and the sociocultural context in which the violence occurs. Additionally, longitudinal studies that follow women over time could provide valuable insights into the long-term impacts of domestic violence on women's labor force participation and economic well-being. Such research is crucial for developing effective interventions that support women's empowerment and well-being, while also addressing the root causes of domestic violence. 
 
Data Collection 
 
To measure the causal impact of female empowerment on rates of reported domestic violence, we conducted an instrumental variable analysis using the female labor force participation rate (FLFPR) for women aged 25-54 as an instrument.   We obtained administrative data on domestic violence reports from law enforcement agencies in the study area. Concurrently, we utilized government labor force survey data to calculate the FLFPR, defined as the percentage of women aged 25-54 who were employed or actively seeking work. This age range was chosen to focus on prime working-age women post schooling and to maintain consistency with standard labor market definitions used by national statistical agencies.  The key identifying assumption was that the FLFPR influences domestic violence reporting only through its effect on female empowerment. As women gain education, face less discrimination in the workplace, and benefit from evolving social norms, their workforce engagement tends to rise. This economic participation enhances women's financial independence, intra-household bargaining power, and self-determination. However, conditional on relevant covariates, the FLFPR is plausibly exogenous and unlikely to directly impact domestic violence reporting through other channels.  To bolster data quality, we thoroughly cleaned and validated the administrative reports, cross-referencing them against hospital records and victimization survey data where possible. Labor force survey data went through standard consistency checks and were benchmarked against external sources. We addressed small amounts of missing data using multiple imputation methods that account for the panel structure and time trends.  In the first stage of the instrumental variable regression, we predicted female empowerment levels based on the FLFPR, controlling for a rich set of individual and area-level characteristics. The second stage then used these predicted empowerment values to estimate the causal effect on domestic violence reports. We included individual fixed effects to account for time-invariant unobservables and area-by-year fixed effects to flexibly capture local trends. Standard errors were clustered at the area level to allow for serial correlation and heteroskedasticity.  One limitation is that both domestic violence and employment are likely underreported in official data due to stigma, fear, and survey design issues. Empowerment gains may also occur with a time lag from FLFPR increases or be imprecisely captured by the participation rate alone. Primary survey data could provide more direct empowerment measures, but may suffer from social desirability bias and lack the scale and representativeness of administrative records.  Nonetheless, using the FLFPR as a proxy takes advantage of the data's broad coverage, regular collection, and concrete, behavioral nature. The instrumental variable approach aims to isolate the empowerment effect from reverse causality, i.e. domestic violence reducing employment, and from selection bias driven by unobserved victim characteristics. While not perfect, this strategy provides evidence on an important and typically difficult-to-study question. We hope this work encourages further research using alternative empowerment proxies, richer data on the nature and severity of domestic violence, and in-depth examinations of reporting behavior.
