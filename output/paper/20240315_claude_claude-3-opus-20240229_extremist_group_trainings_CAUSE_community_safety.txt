 
Sowing Seeds of Destruction: Examining the Impact of Extremist Indoctrination on Communal Cohesion and Public Security 
 
Data Collection 
 
To evaluate the impact of a community safety program on crime rates, we conducted a randomized controlled trial across 50 similar communities. We first partnered with local law enforcement agencies to gather baseline data on crime rates, measured as the number of crimes reported to police per 1,000 residents over the prior 12 months. Communities were then randomly assigned to treatment and control groups, with 25 in each.   The treatment communities received a comprehensive safety intervention which included increased police patrols, neighborhood watch programs, improved street lighting, and youth outreach services. These measures were implemented consistently over an 18-month period. Meanwhile, the control communities received no additional interventions beyond existing services.  Throughout the study period, we continued to collect monthly crime report data from police departments in all 50 communities. To encourage consistent data collection, our research team conducted quarterly data quality audits and worked closely with law enforcement to resolve any discrepancies or missing data issues. Attrition was minimal, with 48 of the 50 communities remaining in the study for the full duration.  After 18 months, we compared the change in crime rates from baseline between the treatment and control groups. We found that treatment communities experienced a 20% greater reduction in crime on average relative to the control group (p<0.01). These results were robust to controlling for relevant demographic and socioeconomic covariates.  Measuring crime rates using reported crimes has advantages of being an observable, well-defined and regularly collected metric. However, it may underestimate true crime levels if crimes go unreported. Victim surveys could provide a more comprehensive view but are more costly to administer. Additionally, while randomization ensured the treatment and control groups were similar on average, there were a few cases of communities not fully complying with their treatment assignment which could attenuate the estimated effects.  Overall, our randomized trial demonstrates that a multi-pronged community safety intervention can significantly reduce crime. The data quality protocols and low attrition give us confidence in the internal validity of the results. Going forward, replicating this study in different contexts would help establish the external validity and generalizability of the findings.
