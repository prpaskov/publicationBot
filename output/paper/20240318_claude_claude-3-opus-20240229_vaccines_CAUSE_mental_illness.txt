 
Investigating the Potential Nexus Between Vaccinations and Neuropsychiatric Disorders: A Comprehensive Review and Analysis 
 
Data Collection 
 
To conduct this randomized controlled trial on the effect of the intervention on mental illness diagnosis rates, we first obtained Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval and informed consent from all participants. We partnered with licensed mental health professionals to recruit individuals currently experiencing mental health issues from their patient pools across five large US cities.  Individuals were randomly assigned to a treatment group that received the intervention, or a control group that received usual care. Randomization was done using a computer-generated sequence, stratified by city and baseline diagnosis type. Participants, professionals, and study personnel were blinded to treatment assignment.   At the start of the study, we collected baseline data on mental illness diagnoses for all participants through a combination of validated self-report symptom surveys (e.g., PHQ-9, GAD-7) and reviews of medical records, obtained with participant consent. Diagnoses were made by licensed professionals based on DSM-5 criteria. While we recognize diagnosis rates may underestimate true prevalence, as not all individuals with mental illness receive clinical diagnoses, they provide an objective and policy-relevant measure.  The manualized intervention was delivered to the treatment group by trained facilitators over 12 weekly sessions, while the control group received usual care. Fidelity to the intervention protocol was rigorously monitored through session logs and random observations. At the end of the intervention period, endpoint data on mental illness diagnoses was again collected for all participants using the same procedure as baseline. Longer-term follow-up assessments are ongoing.  The final sample included 500 participants (250 per group). 82% of enrolled participants were retained through study completion. Non-compliance to the intervention schedule (defined as attending <80% of sessions) was 24% in the treatment group. To maximize statistical power and internal validity, we used an intent-to-treat analysis to estimate the causal effect of the intervention on mental illness diagnosis rates. Multivariate logistic regressions controlled for baseline diagnosis rates and relevant demographic covariates. Heterogeneity analysis explored differential effects by baseline diagnosis type and other moderators. Sensitivity analyses assessed robustness to alternative specifications.  Key strengths of this design include the multi-site randomized controlled approach, blinded and objectively-measured outcomes, manualized intervention, and sophisticated analytic techniques. Limitations include uncertain generalizability beyond the study sample and potential biases from non-compliance and attrition. However, established econometric and clinical trial methods were employed to mitigate these issues and provide credible causal estimates within this sample. All study procedures were reviewed and approved by the IRB. Data was securely stored with robust privacy safeguards and analyzed only in de-identified form. Study results will be published following CONSORT guidelines.
