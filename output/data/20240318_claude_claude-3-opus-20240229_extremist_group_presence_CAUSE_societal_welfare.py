This code generates a balanced longitudinal dataset with 2,160 observations (36 months * 6 cities = 2,160). The cities are randomly assigned to treatment and control groups, with Kuwait City, Hawalli, and Farwaniya receiving the self-defense system intervention starting from July 1, 2021. 

The dataset includes the following variables:
- date: Monthly time points from January 1, 2020 to December 31, 2022
- city: The six metropolitan areas in Kuwait
- gdp_per_capita, academic_achievement, crime_rate: Baseline demographic variables balanced across cities  
- life_expectancy: The outcome variable
- intervention: A binary variable indicating whether the city received the intervention (1) or not (0)

The life expectancy for the treatment cities after the intervention is set to increase by a more conservative 0.5 years, instead of the previous 2 years, to reflect a more realistic effect size. The intervention variable is also explicitly added to the dataset to facilitate the analysis of the treatment effect.

The data is exported to a CSV file named "kuwait_life_expectancy_data.csv". This dataset follows the specified randomized controlled trial methodology and can be used to illustrate the potential impact of self-defense systems on life expectancy as a proxy for societal welfare in Kuwait metropolitan areas.
